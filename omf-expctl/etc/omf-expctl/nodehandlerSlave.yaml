    # Config Parameter for the "default" Testbed
    #
    default:
    
      # This is the default name for the default testbed
      # NH will use this name if NO domain has been given on the command lide ( -d option)
      # This is optional. When 'name' is not present, the NH will take the first
      # sub-domain of the host it is executing on as the default testbed name.
      # (e.g. domain: 'indoor.nicta.com.au' will result in the name 'indoor')
      # IMPORTANT: 
      #   Your Inventory database *must* hold information about the testbed you name 
      #   (e.g. the 'testbeds' table must have an entry corresponding to this name)
      name: 'local'

      # This is the Path where NH should look for its repository of built in experiments
      # (e.g. example experiments, maintenance experiments, etc...)
      repository:
        path: ["../repository", "/usr/lib/ruby/1.8/omf-expctl/repository"]

      # This is the Url where NH can contact the Inventory Service
      inventory:
        url: 'http://localhost:5022/inventory'

      # This is the command used to launch the communication module
      # The type of comm module to launch depends on the cmd line params
      # '-c PORT' runs a TCP comm. module that will connect to the node Agent's TCP server on PORT
      # '-l PORT' runs a TCP comm. Server module that will listen for node Agent's connection on PORT
      #
      # runs a TCP client module
      #commServer: /opt//etc/omf-expctl-4.4.0/sbin/commServer --logfile /tmp/commServer-%ID%.log -d 4 --iface eth1 -c 9026
      #
      # TCP Client - IMPORTANT: in 'Slave Mode' the NH communication will only operate on the localhost interface!
      #commServer: /opt/omf-expctl-4.4.0/sbin/commServer --logfile /tmp/commServer-%ID%.log -d 4 --iface lo -c 9026

    # Config Parameter for the "debug" Testbed
    #
    # To use this testbed, call nodeHandler with the option PRINT_ONLY or "-d debug"
    # Any parameter settings within this section will override the settings 
    # done in the "default" section. The nodeHandler fisrt load the "default"
    # settings, then it uses the "domain" specific settings to override the 
    # relevant parameters
