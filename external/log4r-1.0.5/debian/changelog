liblog4r-ruby (1.0.5-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Bumped standards version to 3.7.2; no changes required.
  * debian/rules:
      - modified the build/install system to use CDBS.  Upstream comes
        without any build/install system, so using dh_install to copy stuff.
      - added support for CDBS' simple-patchsys.
  * debian/control.in:
      moved the build-depends-indep on cdbs and debhelper to build-depends.
  * debian/liblog4r-ruby1.8.docs:
      removed because README is already installed by default.
  * debian/patches:
      + added 01_emailoutputter-postpone-smtp.patch to let the email
        outputter open the SMTP connection only when needed (patch courtesy
        of Marc Dequènes, closes #361349).
      + added 02_emailoutputter-exception-reraise.patch that reraises
        the exceptions caught by the emailoutputter so the environment
        receives them too (closes: #361780).
