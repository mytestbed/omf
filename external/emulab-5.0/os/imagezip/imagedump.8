.Dt IMAGEDUMP 8
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm imagedump
.Nd dump information about an imagezip compressed image file
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl div
.Ar imagefile ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility can be used to view information about
.Xr imagezip
created image files.
With no options,
.Nm
prints a summary for each image file specified.  This summary includes:
the size of the image file, the size of the resulting decompressed data,
the compression factor achieved on allocated data (due to
.Xr zlib Ns
),
the overall compression factor (due to smart filesystem aware compression and
.Xr zlib Ns
),
and the amount of overhead and wasted space in the image file
(due to the way in which compressed data is chunked in the image file).
.Pp
One or more
.Fl d
options can be specified to dump various levels of structure within the
image file.
.Pp
The
.Fl i
option tells
.Nm
to ignore the deprecated blockindex field in chunk headers.
You need this option when running
.Nm
on pieces of a split image.
.Pp
The
.Fl v
option prints version information about
.Nm
itself.
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
The
.Nm
utility will exit with a status of zero if it successfully parses and
dumps all the listed image files.
It will exit non-zero if there is any error.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr imagezip 8 ,
.Xr imageunzip 8 ,
.Xr zlib 3
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
utility is part of the Netbed software (www.netbed.org).
.Sh BUGS
The
.Xr imagedump
image format needs to be documented.
