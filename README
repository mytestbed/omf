Current Status
--------------
The OMF framework is a replacement for some of the existing components of 
orbit-lab software. 

Some of the reasons for cloning include:-
 * to simplify the directory structure and dependencies, as discussed below
 * to allow for building outside of Winlab

OMF is a work in progress.
Status of specific components:
* All components build and install OK.
* PXE boots & runs, tested on VIA MB720 and MB770.
* nodeagent4 runs OK
* OTG (from current orbit-lab branch, not part of OMF) runs OK


Structure of the Orbit Management Framework OMF
-----------------------------------------------
The key makefile and directory structure is:

omf /  
      build        # outputs are built here
      nodeAgent    # each app. directory has a local Makefile,
      nodeHandler  #   which includes tool/lib/makefile-ruby
      pxe          #   and that includes {app}/src/debian/Makefile.deb
      gridService  #   to build the debian packages
      tool         # common makefile and scripts
      commons      # ruby utilities, mainly networking

make targets:

app           # just build the application
all           # build app and create packages
install-apt   # build and install to apt server (using scp to copy it over)
install-local # makes a local deb package for installation 
install       # alias for install-apt
clean         # simply removes the build directory

Installation directories:

/usr/bin      # top exe's e.g. nodehandler4 sets path & indirectly calls 
              #    /opt/nodehandler4-4.2.0/lib/handler/nodeHandler.rb
/opt/nodehandler4-4.2.0    # libraries, examples/tutorials
/etc/nodehandler4          # configuration files, default for winlab

similarly for /usr/bin/gridservices2, and so on.


Building outside of Winlab
--------------------------
orbit-lab software is primarily intended to be built at Winlab. However, it has 
been ported to the environment at National ICT Australia (NICTA), and in so 
doing, the build has been made more portable. 

To enable building at NICTA as well as Winlab, the strategy is to use some 
make variables for the site specific information. If the site variables are
not given, the default setting is for Winlab.

One variable is setup as an environment variable, because it is unique to the 
person running the make:

$MAINTAINER    e.g. "Jo Blo <jo@nicta.com.au>" for NICTA (not needed at Winlab)
Run gpg to create your own key to match the supplied email address exactly.

The Makefiles were modified to pass the local maintainer, if supplied, to the 
dpkg-buildpackage tool. This is necessary, because the Winlab maintainer's 
signatures are not available outside Winlab.

The remaining variables are setup in an included makefile "omf/site.mk". 
The appropriate file for NICTA is "omf/nicta.mk", which is checked in 
to the SVN repository.

To build at Winlab, just run the usual make commands.

To build at NICTA, symlink, copy or rename "omf/nicta.mk" as "omf/site.mk",
and then run the usual make commands.

To build at another site, setup an apt repository on a server, and
specify the various paths to that server in site.mk following the 
example of nicta.mk

nicta.mk contains the following variables:

#   The first group of variables defines the apt-get or wget URL
#    to fetch locally cached deb packages:
#   URL = $APT_HOST/$WINLAB_REP  (or MAIN_REP for main section)
APT_HOST = http://203.143.174.94
WINLAB_REP = dists/testing/winlab/binary-i386
MAIN_REP = dists/testing/main/binary-i386
KEXEC_REP = dists/testing/main/binary-i386

#   The next group of variables defines the scp target to copy
#    files into the local repository.
#   scp target = $REPOSITORY:$REPOSITORY_ROOT/$APP_PATH
#    APP_PATH is determined in the Makefile, by examining the changelog
REPOSITORY = $(USER)@norbit.npc.nicta.com.au
REPOSITORY_ROOT = /var/www/dists


Modifications made for NICTA support
------------------------------------
    * Patch applied to kernel module net/via-rhine.c, which fixes a bug 
preventing consecutive PXE boots on any board using VT6103 ethernet chip 
e.g. VIA MB720 mini-ITX
    * Add several kernel drivers, e.g.
          o R8169 realtek gigabit ethernet, and VIA Velocity gigabit ethernet
          o Replace UB driver with a number of USB and generic SCSI modules needed for USB support and flash memory support
          o Extra filesystems msdos, fat, vfat for flash memory support 
    * Mods to /etc/rcS:
          o bring up eth0 and eth1 (not just eth1)
          o "MAKEDEV" sda for flash memory support
          o mount sysfs and usbfs 
    * Add more applets in the busybox build:
          o head, who, crontab, wc, id, adduser, addgroup, ifup/down, traceroute, install, top, watchdog 
    * Modify /etc/udhcp.script to set the hostname based on the first name received from the DHCP server (previously set IP as name)
    * Change the gridservices2 port to 5022, to permit concurrent use of gridservices on 5012 (until OML is ported to gridservices2).
    * Create local stubs for CMC (chassis management service) as appropriate to the NICTA testbed
